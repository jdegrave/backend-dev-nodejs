    - First shell: Thompson shell
      - Written at Bell Labs in 1971
      - Lots of features for subsequent shells came from this one
    - First "modern" shells: Bourne shell & C shell
      - Bourne shell
        - 1979 at Bell Labs
        - Every current macOS & Linux distro comes with a version of this shell called `bash`
