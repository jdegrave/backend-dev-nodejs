# Nested Data

- Create one of each of the following (do not turn in work identical to the examples from class):
  - an array of arrays
  - an object with an array
  - an object with another object for a property
  - an array of objects (can be defined in unique variables or on the fly)

# Conditionals

- Write one ternary operator where it is checking against a string
- Write a simple if statement checking to see if a number is not equal to a variable
- Expand on the custom greeting exercise from class, but create further else if checks for at least three other people
- Convert the above assignment to do the same thing, but with a switch statement
