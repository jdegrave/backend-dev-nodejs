# Lecture 3 - JavaScript Basics - Exercises

## Exercise 1

Create `for` loop that counts from 1 to 10 and pushes the current number in an array and then logs it to the console. At the end of the loop, the following should be logged to the console: 'I can count to 10: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]'.

## Exercise 2

Create an object that has 5 properties with string values. Create a `for-in` loop that logs each property's value to the console.

## Exercise 3

Create a `for` loop that iterates over an array with 10 numbers in it. The loop should double each number in the array and log the resulting object to the console once the loop is complete.

## Exercise 4

Create a `do-while` loop that iterates over the following array: `['Ford', 'Chevy', 'BMW', 'Audi', 'VW']` and transforms each element in the array into an object which contains the `make` and `model` of the car for the `make` of the array element.

## Exercise 5

Create a `while` loop that logs 5 different values to the console.

## Exercise 6

Create a function that takes a string as an argument and reverses it.
