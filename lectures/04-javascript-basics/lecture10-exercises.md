## Exercise 1

Compare two strings by the sum of their character values. The strings should not be case sensitive. Return 'equal' if the strings are equal and 'not equal' if they are not.


## Exercise 2

We know the population for a small town at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by a certain percent per year and moreover a given number of new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to a population goal? Write this function.


## Exercise 3

Write a function that accepts a sequence of positive numbers as a string. There is at least one number missing.  Return the first missing number in the sequence.

If the array contains any invalid elements (negative numbers, alphabetic characters, punctuation), return 1.

If the array is empty or no number is missing, return 0.

If more than one number is missing, return the smallest missing number.

The sequence you receive is not necessarily in numeric order.
