# Exercise 1

Create a function that uses a closure to one number to another number. The first number should be stored in a closure.

Hint: you're actually creating multiple functions.

```js
console.log(addTen(30))       // 40
console.log(addTwenty(30))    // 50
console.log(addFifty(30))     // 80
```
