# JavaScript Promises

- What is a Promise?
  - Creation
  - `.then`
  - `.catch`
  - `resolve`
  - `reject`
- Exercise 1
- Exercise 2
- How do they work?
  - Let's build our own!
  - This is a naive implementation
    - In reality, promises have state:
      - `pending`
      - `resolved`
      - `rejected`
- Chaining promises
- `Promise.all`
