# Homework 1 - Your Own Menagerie

- Create a new git repository
- Create an Express API for the animals of your choice
- It should contain:
  - At least 3 types of animals
  - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests for each animal
  - The animals should be stored in their own individual modules
  - We should be able to sort the animals returned from the API by their ID and one other parameter of your choosing

- Bonus:
  - Increment the ID automatically when inserting a new animal
  - Update only the properties that change when making an update request
  - Add error handling
